# Resume Website with Admin Panel

This project is a personal resume website developed using Rust and the Yew framework for the frontend. It includes a backend and an admin panel for managing user information, such as updating personal details, skills, and experience.

## Features

- Frontend: Built with Yew, a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web applications. The user interface is clean, responsive, and designed to present your resume in a professional manner.
- Admin Panel: An easy-to-use interface for administrators to update personal information, including the userâ€™s name, description, and other details. This allows you to maintain and customize your resume without needing to modify the underlying code.
- Backend: Powered by Rust, with a focus on handling data securely and efficiently. The backend includes a simple database integration to store user information and serve it to the frontend.
- User Data Management: Admins can change and update the user's information (e.g., fullname, description, skills) directly from the admin panel. Data is stored persistently in the backend database and dynamically reflected on the resume page.
